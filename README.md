### Hi, I'm Raunak ðŸ˜„

I have a civil engineering background, but I'm currently a blockchain/fullstack engineer in the Defi space (at [Mimo Labs](https://www.mimo.capital)). Before then, I was an early engineer for [Cultiveit](http://cultiveit.io), a burnout consulting company. In my civil engineering days, I worked on public infrastructure in Los Angeles. I am constantly finding new ways to utilize my unique background and interests. 

- ðŸŒ± When I'm not working, I've been [learking Haskell](https://github.com/RnkSngh/trikona) and working on my [Journaling Webapp](http://journaling-webapp.vercel.app)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about working in early-stage startups, blockchain, streamlining communication across teams
