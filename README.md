### Hi, I'm [Raunak](http://rnksngh.com) ðŸ˜„

I'm currently a protocol engineer at [Polymer Labs](https://www.polymerlabs.org). Before then, I was a blockchain engineer for a [stablecoin protocol](https://www.mimo.capital) where I built and deployed contracts that have securely managed tens of millions in TVL. Before crypto, I was an early engineer for [Cultiveit](http://cultiveit.io), a burnout consulting company. In a previous life, I was a civil engineering consultant, where I worked on public infrastructure in Los Angeles. I am constantly finding new ways to utilize my unique background and interests. 

- ðŸŒ± When I'm not working, I've been [learning Go](https://github.com/RnkSngh/untouchable-numbers/tree/main/package) and working on my [Journaling Webapp](http://journaling-webapp.vercel.app)
